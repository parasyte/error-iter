# `error-iter`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/parasyte/error-iter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/parasyte/error-iter)
[![unsafe forbidden](https://img.shields.io/badge/unsafe-forbidden-success.svg)](https://github.com/rust-secure-code/safety-dance/)

Use [`Error::iter_chain`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/error/trait.Error.html#method.iter_chain) and [`Error::iter_sources`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/error/trait.Error.html#method.iter_sources) on stable Rust.

## MSRV

Supports Rust 1.37.0 and higher.

Compiles on Rust 1.31.0, but does not return the tail source. (Tests fail on anything less than 1.37.0.)

## What is this?

`iter_chain` and `iter_sources` are incredibly useful for providing error context in Rust applications. For motivation, see [RFC 2504](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2504-fix-error.md). These iterators are available in nightly compilers with [#58520](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/58520) tracking stabilization.

This crate does not attempt to be 100% compatible with the stabilization effort, but does want to provide very similar functionality to stable Rust.

## Show me

`cargo run --example simple`

## Why not a derive macro?

PRs welcome! :)
